Assignment 2 Write-Up

I think I completed this project completely (100 %).  The program works as expected, 
or at least with positive numbers (The assignment does entail positive floats ONLY).
The only problem I think I have with my final product is which steps I've printed.
I'm guessing that the program prints out too much data.  I did my best to format it
for it to be readable.  Then, because the assignment instructions says it MUST
look like the given example but then says to print out the step, I was just unsure
on the wanted product. It's just never going to look exactly the same because the 
example doesn't have the steps printed out like you'd expect.
